# 🎮 Video Game Sales Analysis

This project analyzes global video game sales data to identify trends and insights across platforms, genres, publishers, and regions. It leverages data cleaning, visualization, and interactive dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.

---

## 📊 Overview

- Collected data from Kaggleeaned and analyzed manually collected player data
- Cleaned and wrangled data using Jupyter Notebook using Pandas
- Created initial visualizations in Jupyter Notebook uisng Matplotlib
- Created a Linear Regression model to investigate the relationship and predictive power of a game's genre to its global sales
- Exported cleaned data to an Excel csv befored exporting to Power Bi 
- Visualized key performance indicators (KPIs) utilizing Power Bi

## 📁 Dataset

Collected Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales), includes:

- Name
- Genre
- Publisher
- Platform
- NA_Sales
- EU_Sales
- JP_Sales
- Other_Sales
- Global_Sales

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Python**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For data analysis and report writing
- **Power Bi**: For data visualization

## 📈 Key Findings

- Video games sales peaked during the era where portable consoles and family friendly games such as WII Sports ruled
- There is a possible correlation between publishers and regional sales.
- The top game publsihers generally had the same global success with the exception of Nintendo, who often broke away from the pack most noticably between 2005- 2009 which could be attributed to the major success of the WII console.
- Action, shooters nd sports games dominate the North American and European regions whereas role-playing, action and platform games dominate the Japanese region.
